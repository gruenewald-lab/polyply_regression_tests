# 1 - Generate an itp file for PS-b-PEO

#     restrictions where to place the Salt and a top file only specifying

# 3 - Next we grow the polymer around the salt starting on the domain bounderies.  To do that we need to specify 4 files:
#     a) the domain bounderies are specified as grid points stored in the file grid.dat. Users need to specify this customly.
#        the grid is provided via the -grid option
#     b) the build file specifies where in the box PEO and PS are allowed as done previously for the salt
#     c) the salt input configuration is provided via the '-c' option
#     d) the number of polymers has to be added to the topology file. A good number can typically be guessed based on the density
#        or by running iteratively serval systems until a good number is found. However, if the number is off it only means
#        the relaxation phase will be larger.

# let's add the number of polymers to the topology file

# finally when running the polyply command using the -start option we tell the program to start for the molecules with name PS_PEO with residue 63
# of name PEO. That is the PEO residue connecting to the PS part of the chains. The full command is:
polyply gen_coords -p system.top -b ${INPUT_DIR}/build_file.bld -c salts.gro -o polymers.gro -box 10 63 63 -name polymers -grid ${INPUT_DIR}/grid.dat -start PS_PEO-PEO#63 -nr 15

# 4 - Finally we run an energy minimization with flexible bonds.
gmx grompp -f ${INPUT_DIR}/min.mdp -c polymers.gro -p system.top
gmx mdrun -v

# 5 - Then we run a few MD steps with flexible bonds so that all constraints can relax. In large systems it is important that all constraints
#     are very well matched.
gmx grompp -f ${INPUT_DIR}/constz_flex.mdp -c polymers.gro -p system.top
gmx mdrun -v

# 6 - Now we can start the equilbriations. First we run x ns keeping the z dimension fixed. This will allow the chains to obtain a more
#     compact packing in case we understimated the number of polymers per unit area
gmx grompp -f ${INPUT_DIR}/constz.mdp -c confout.gro -p system.top
gmx mdrun -v -s topol.tpr -deffnm constz

# 7 - After the intial relaxation of the xy dimnesion we switch to constant area to let z fluctuate, if needed. We run at constant area
#     because otherwise the simulation will try to minize the interface smearing out the simulation and eventually leading to a crash.
